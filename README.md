Hello,

As I have already communicated to you for a while I am no longer active on the script.
For various reasons I can't afford to keep the script up to date with GTA and Stand but also to add new relevant features (which was not always the case by the way).

I would like to thank you for supporting me by using my script and giving me relevant feedbacks ! 

Unfortunately I announce you that I close definitively the development of the mehScript.
I still leave the possibility to download it in #download and also on my github.

I know that it was far from being an indispensable script and that it doesn't need to make such a message but I prefer to be honest with you.

So, thanks and good luck.
